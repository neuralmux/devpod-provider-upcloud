- üîê **SSH Key Authentication** - Secure access with automatic SSH key injection
- üåç **Global Zones** - Deploy to 13+ data centers worldwide
- üíæ **Flexible Storage** - Configurable SSD storage with MaxIOPS tier

## What are Providers?

Providers are CLI programs that let DevPod create, manage and run workspaces on different backends. They define commands to create, delete and connect to development environments in the cloud.

DevPod relies on the provider model for flexibility and adaptability. Providers are defined through a provider.yaml that specifies options, configuration, and commands needed for workspace management.

## Usage

To use this provider in your DevPod setup, you will need to do the following steps:

1. See the [DevPod documentation](https://devpod.sh/docs/managing-providers/add-provider)
   for how to add a provider
1. Use the reference `neuralmux/devpod-provider-upcloud` to download the latest
   release from GitHub
1. Set up an [API user](https://upcloud.com/docs/guides/getting-started-upcloud-api/)
   in UpCloud Control Panel. This will be used to manage resources.

## Installation

### Using the CLI

```
devpod provider add github.com/neuralmux/devpod-provider-upcloud
